We’re a full-stack team responsible for search.
We build and maintain the OpenSearch indexing pipeline, global and scoped queries, and the search UI.
Relevance tuning, facets, query performance — that's our domain.

We prefer to work behind the scenes, ensuring users find what they need without thinking about how it happens.
Good search is invisible until it’s missing.

## Name origin

The name Lynx reflects our approach: sharp-eyed, precise, and efficient.
We see patterns in the noise and surface what matters.
Like the animal, we're observant and operate best when we're not the center of attention — just quietly doing the work that makes everything else discoverable.
