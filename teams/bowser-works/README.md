# Bowser Works

> Browser Just Works™.

We’re a mix of full-stack engineers and front-end engineers.
The component library and the web shell (micro-front-end host app) represent the biggest things we own.
We also own others parts of the cient web app, the marketing web-site, and front-end common code.

We work closely with Goose Squadron to set front-end standards.

## Name origin

Yes, that Bowser.

A few of us love Nintendo, so we wanted a fun name.
Bowser and Browser just work well together, plus we own the shell, so it just made sense.
We added Works, like Skunk Works, to finish the name.
Because the browser Just Works™.
