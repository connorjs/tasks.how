> Smart chatter. Sharp signal.

We manage all things collaboration and communication.
Comments, mentions, activity feeds, notifications, realtime updates, and more.
If people are talking or being notified, we own it.

## Name origin

The name Magpies suits us for a few reasons.
Magpies are highly intelligent birds known for their complex vocalizations and social behavior.
(Sound familiar?)

They’re also collectors,
which mirrors how we aggregate activity and surface the right information at the right time.
We’re the ones making sure important messages don’t get lost in the feed.
