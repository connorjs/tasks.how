# Goose Squadron

> Flight-ready flow.
>
> _Formation within chaos. Clarity amid noise._

We’re a full-stack team that focuses primarily on the front-end.
We deliver the core experiences of task management: boards, lists, timelines, and navigating task hierarchies.

## Name origin

Our name Goose Squadron pairs well with The Ducks – the team owning the core tasks and project services – whom we work with a lot given our core area.
We chose the name to reflect the chaos energy we bring to the table (being a fun, front-end team),
but also because of the flying V formation.
