# Cerberus

> Guard the gates. Power the forge.

We’re the Platform / Builder Tools / DevEx team.
If it’s infrastructure, developer experience, or enablement, then it's probably ours.
Recently, we’ve also taken on the Automation API in advance of RPA / AI / MCP integrations.

We work with the entire organization to set guidelines and make decisions, including the Architecture Working Group.
In other words: We don’t own the decisions, but we build the tools that enforce them.

Our philosophy is simple: pave the path, eliminate toil, and fall into the pit of success.

## Name origin

We named ourselves Cerberus because we guard the gates to production and power the forge where teams build.
Three heads, many responsibilities: one for tooling, one for platform reliability, and one for developer happiness.
We’re not here to block; we’re here to enable at scale.
