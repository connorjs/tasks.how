We’re the back-end team owning the core domain models (Tasks, Projects, Board structure, workflows).
If it’s a core business function, there’s a good chance we own it (or someone will give it to us to own).

## Name origin

We named ourselves “The Ducks” because we love Ducks.
One member goes to feed them at a local park and another cares for injured ducks.
Given that shared love,
and the mention of “We keep your ducks in a row” when discussing mottos,
it was an easy choice.

Plus, Runner Ducks are just the best.
